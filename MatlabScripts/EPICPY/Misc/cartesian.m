function output = cartesian(varargin)
%   CARTESIAN takes the cartesian product (combinations of) the input
%
%   output = CARTESIAN(A) computes the cartesian product of the rows in A
%
%   output = CARTESIAN(a, b, c, ...) computes the cartesian product of the
%   vectors a, b, c ...
%   
%   INPUT: 
%           varargin: Vectors for which to compute cartesian product [Either a M
%           X N matrix, with M the different vectors and N the length of each
%           vector or M vectors (in which case they can be of different length]
%
%   OUTPUT: 
%           output: Contains all possible combinations of the different elements
%           [K x M matrix]
